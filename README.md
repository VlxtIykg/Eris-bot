# Process of what has been done

I haven't uploaded to github in 8 days, what I have done is

-Create a json and env parser <br>
-Create a database with a table of how I want things to be <br>
-Maneuver certain stuff to export and import <br>
-Learnt how to remove Module: null prototype   <br>
<sub>What causes Module null prototype? Importing two things asynchronously. <br>
How to get rid of it? Run the functions separately at different times or call the await import in one function and export it to the two async functions<br></sub>
-Add a command handler
